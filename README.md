The additional lines you provided are showing the validation loss and accuracy after the last epoch (Epoch 20/20). 

- **Validation loss:** This is the loss (in this case, categorical cross-entropy) computed on the validation dataset after the final epoch. It indicates how well the model is performing on unseen data.
- **Validation accuracy:** This is the accuracy of the model on the validation dataset after the final epoch. It represents the proportion of correctly classified samples in the validation dataset.

In your case:

- **Validation loss:** 3.8169
- **Validation accuracy:** 0.1489

These values confirm what was observed throughout training: the model's performance on the validation dataset is relatively poor, with a low accuracy and relatively high loss. This further supports the indication of overfitting, where the model is learning to perform well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.
